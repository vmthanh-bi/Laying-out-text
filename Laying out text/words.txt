Here are some suggestions on how to approach the problem.
The most important observation is that this problem has a
natural recursive structure: to lay out a large block of
text we start by deciding how many words should appear on
the first line. Once we make that decision the problem
reduces to recursively laying out the remaining words on the
following lines. In deciding how many words to put on the
first line you have to start by determining the maximum
number of words that will fit on that first line. Then, you
should try every possible configuration for that first line
ranging from putting just one word on that line up to the
maximum number of words that will fit on that line. For each
configuration you try you will need to figure out the
penalty for the first line and add that penalty to the
lowest penalty returned by the recursive call. The winning
configuration is the one that minimizes the sum of the first
line penalty and the subsequent line penalties: this is the
value you will return from the function.
